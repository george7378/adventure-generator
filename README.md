# adventure-generator
A simple program which generates random coordinates within a specified distance of your home. Decide how far you're willing to travel, then refresh the output until you find a spot that's reachable using whatever transport you prefer. Once you have your coordinates, the rest is up to your imagination. Go from point to point to see how many sequential spots you can cross off in one day. How about trying to get to the destination in a straight line? On a unicycle? Walking backwards? Stage a race with friends along different routes to see who gets there first?

Inspired by [Geohashing](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page), which is an awesome idea to get people out and about. I created this more 'quick fire' alternative to relieve some boredom while hanging around in the English countryside without much to do, and not wanting to wait months for an accessible Geohash spot to appear within walking distance.

The interface is simple - just enter your home spot, choose your range limits and press **Go!** to generate a random destination. You can press the **Map** button to visualise the point in Google Maps. You're given the option to append more parameters to the map URL before it's displayed. Any valid inputs will be saved for convenience when you close the program.

Safe travels!
